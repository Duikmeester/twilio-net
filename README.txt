Twilio-Net is a set of .Net components for integrating with the Twilio call solution (www.twilio.com).

Twilio.Activities contains a set of Windows Workflow Foundation activities that can be integrated into a workflow to produce TwiML output. This allows call flow to be designed visually using Windows Workflow Foundation, when a workflow is exposed properly from an HTTP endpoint.
